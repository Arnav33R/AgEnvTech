## What it's about
BlocklyProp Solo is a visual online programming tool designed to work with robots and development boards featuring a Propeller 1 Multicore Microcontroller brain, such as the ActivityBot 360° and Propeller FLiP module. It allows users to build Propeller programs graphically, using specialized blocks to support sensors, servo motors, displays, and more.

## What you need to get started
- A Windows, Mac, or Chromebook computer with a USB 2.0 compatible port
- Permission to install BlocklyProp Launcher software (*Schools may need IT assistance)
- Chrome browser (Explorer and Edge are not supported)
- A Propeller board with its USB programming cable, such as:
  - [ActivityBot 360°](https://www.parallax.com/product/32600)
  - [Propeller Activity Board WX](https://www.parallax.com/product/32912)
  - [Propeller FLiP Module](https://www.parallax.com/product/32123)

For assistance, contact support@parallax.com or call the Educator Hotline (916) 701-8625.

(*The Launcher allows a USB connection for downloading code to your Propeller board. BlocklyProp Solo and the Launcher do not require any login and do not collect any user data.)

## BlocklyProp Launcher
BlocklyProp Solo, despite being an online programming tool, requires a utility on your computer to establish a USB programming connection with your Propeller board.

### Installing the Launcher Ahead of Time
- Download and install the [BlocklyProp Launcher](https://www.parallax.com/package/blocklyprop-solo-launcher-and-faq-for-schools-downloads/) for Windows or Mac, or get the extension for Chromebook, from the Parallax store site.
- Alternatively, get the latest Launcher through BlocklyProp Solo itself by following the provided steps.

## Opening BlocklyProp Solo
Once BlocklyProp Solo is open in Chrome and the Launcher and drivers are installed, proceed to connect your hardware and run your first project.

### Connect your Hardware
- Connect your Propeller board to your computer's USB port with its programming cable.
- Ensure the Propeller Activity Board's power switch is in position 1 if you're using it.
- Both the Propeller Activity Board and the Propeller FLiP module are powered through the USB connection.

### Create a Project
BlocklyProp programs, also known as "projects," are built graphically using blocks.

1. In the Edit pane, select blocks from the gray block menu to build your project.
2. For example, click on "Communicate," then "Terminal" to access terminal blocks.
3. Drag and drop the desired blocks into the Editor pane.
4. From the port dropdown menu, select the COM port connected to your Propeller board.
5. Click the arrow button to run the project once. (It won't be saved to the memory on your Propeller board.)
