## Parallax Propellor Board

The Parallax Propeller Activity Board WX is an affordable and fully-featured development board designed for Propeller projects. It comes equipped with a mini solderless breadboard, expanded I/O headers, and both 3.3V and 5V power regulators, allowing users to easily build Kickstart demonstration projects or Propeller C tutorials.

- **Key Features**:
    - **Integrated Solderless Breadboard**: The board includes a mini solderless breadboard, facilitating projects with short jumper wires like the 100mm Male-Male Jumper Wires.

    - **Power Options**:
        - USB Cable: Power can be supplied via a USB cable during programming and testing. Note that USB ports typically provide up to 500 mA of current.
        - Separate Power Supply: Alternatively, a 6-9 volt battery pack or a power adapter delivering at least 1 amp at 6 to 9 volts can be used when untethered from a computer.

    - **3-Position Power Switch**: The board features a 3-position switch to control power distribution:
        - Position 0: Removes power from all power pin connections.
        - Position 1: Applies power to the breadboard power pins, excluding the six servo headers.
        - Position 2: Applies power to both the breadboard pins and the servo headers.
    - **Using Servo Headers**: The servo headers facilitate easy testing of Parallax continuous or standard servo motors. Additional information is available in the documentation.
    - **Adapting Wiring Diagrams**: Wiring diagrams from Kickstart projects can be adapted for use with the Propeller Activity Board. Depending on the original diagram:
